			Being the most produced naval fighter of WW2, the F4U Corsair is a well-known American 
			fighter that dominated the skies above the Pacific. The earlier varients of F4U were out-matched 
			by the Japanese Zero, but the aircraft has received countless upgrades as the war went on and 
			reigned supreme. The 4B varient is one of the most advanced model introduced late war, and it 
			also saw some use in the Korean War. 
			<br><br>
			This is currently my proudest work. It took me around 1 months to make since I consulted many 
			images/documents to try to keep it as historically accurate as I can and spent a great amount 
			of time on details and fine tuning.
