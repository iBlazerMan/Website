	Being the most produced naval fighter of WW2, the F4U Corsair is a well-known American fighter that dominated the skies above the Pacific. The earlier varients of F4U were out-matched by the Japanese Zero, but the aircraft has received countless upgrades as the war went on and reigned supreme. The 4B varient is one of the most advanced model introduced late war, and it also saw some use in the Korean War. <br><br>This is currently my proudest work. It took me around 1 months to make since I consulted many images/documents to try to keep it as historically accurate as I can and spent a great amount of time on details and fine tuning. <br>
