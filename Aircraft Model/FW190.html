	Germany's second most produced fighter after the BF 109, the Focke-Wulf 190 was a highly respected aircraft throughout WW2. When it was first introduced in August 1941, it out-performed every single allied fighter in service, and the Brits were forced to immediately develop and upgrade their aircrafts against this new threat. The A8 varient is the most produced FW model, and it earned its name by downing thousands of allied fighters and bombers.
	 <br><br>This is my first ever model made, and although it did turn out to be better than I expected, it is still lacking lots of details throughout the model. <br>
