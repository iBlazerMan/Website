		Ask any of my friend what my favourite food is, and they'll immediately respond with pizza. I love every single component of a pizza, and the combination of the dough, pizza sauce, cheese and the toppings is unmatched and truly a gift from above. Some of my favourite toppings include but not limited to pepperoni, cheese, bacon w/Alfredo sauce, Quebecois, and BBQ chicken. The only topping that I absolutely despise is pineapple (no thanks). <br>
