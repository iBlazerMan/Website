			In 1903, Wilbur Wright said "Not within a thousand years would man ever fly-- To build a 
			flying machine would require the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanics 
			for one million to ten million years". 9 week later, on December the 17th, 1903, the Wright 
			brothers achieved flight.

			The Wrights built their first aircraft, the Wright Flyer, using spruce wood for straight members 
			of the airframe (such as wing spars) and ash wood for curved components (wing ribs). 
			The wings were designed with a 1-in-20 camber. Since they could not find a suitable automobile 
			engine for the task, they commissioned their employee Charlie Taylor to build a new design from scratch, 
			a lightweight 12-horsepower gasoline engine (In comparison, a single engine from the Boeing 777 today 
			produces an equivalence of 52,000 horsepower), weighing 180 pounds (82 kg), with a 1-US-gallon fuel tank.

			A sprocket chain drive, borrowing from bicycle technology, powered the twin propellers, which were also made by 
			hand. In order to avoid the risk of  torque effects from affecting the aircraft handling, one drive chain was 
			crossed over so that the propellers rotated in opposite directions.
			<br><br>
			The Wright brothers flew the Wright Flyer four times that day on land now part of the town of Kill Devil Hills, 
			about 6 kilometers south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The aircraft was preserved and is now exhibited in the 
			National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
