			The Tenerife airport disaster occurred on March 27, 1977, when two Boeing 747 passenger jets collided on the runway 
			at Los Rodeos Airport (now Tenerife North Airport) on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The collision occurred when KLM 
			Flight 4805 initiated its takeoff run while Pan Am Flight 1736 was still on the runway. The impact and resulting fire 
			killed everyone on board KLM 4805 and most of the occupants of Pan Am 1736, with only 61 survivors in the front section 
			of the aircraft. With 583 fatalities, it is currently the deadliest accident in aviation history.

			Both planes involved in the crash had been scheduled to depart from Las Palmas on the island of Gran Canaria. However, 
			a terrorist bombing there earlier in the day caused the planes to be diverted to the small Los Rodeos Airport on the 
			island of Tenerife. Later, just as KLM flight 4805 prepared to take off from the single airstrip at Los Rodeos, the 
			plane barreled into Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flight 1736, which had been taxiing toward takeoff at the same 
			time. The force from the crash tore through the fuselage of the Pan Am plane, and both aircraft exploded into flames. 
			<br><br> 
			There are a huge number of reasons to the cause of this terrible incident such as the KLM plane taking off without 
			proper clearance, foggy weather and unusual airport traffic conditions, and Mentour Pilot made a great video explaining 
			the event:
